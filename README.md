# Smart Graphics Settings for Godot 4.4

A powerful adaptive graphics settings system for Godot 4.4 that automatically adjusts visual quality based on performance to maintain a smooth framerate.

## Release Version

This is the release branch of Smart Graphics Settings, containing only the addon files needed for use in your Godot projects. The current version is **0.1.1**.

## Installation

### Option 1: Godot Asset Library (Recommended)

1. Open your Godot project
2. Go to the AssetLib tab in the Godot editor
3. Search for "Smart Graphics Settings"
4. Download and install directly in the editor

### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Copy the `addons/smart_graphics_settings` folder into your Godot project's `addons` directory
3. Enable the plugin in Project Settings â†’ Plugins

## Quick Start

1. Add the SmartGraphicsSettings node to your main scene or use the autoload singleton
2. Configure your desired target FPS and adjustment settings
3. Run your game - graphics will automatically adjust to maintain performance

# Access the SmartGraphicsSettings singleton directly
# No need for get_node() as it's registered as an autoload

# Enable or disable adaptive graphics
SmartGraphicsSettings.set_enabled(true)

# Set target FPS
SmartGraphicsSettings.set_target_fps(60)

# Show the settings UI
SmartGraphicsSettings.toggle_ui()

## Important Note on Initialization

When accessing `SmartGraphicsSettings` properties like `adaptive_graphics` or calling functions like `set_target_fps` immediately in your script's `_ready()` function, you might encounter issues because the addon performs some initialization steps deferred (after `_ready()` has finished).

To ensure the system is fully initialized before you interact with it at startup, connect to the `SmartGraphicsSettings.initialized` signal:

```gdscript
func _ready():
	if SmartGraphicsSettings.get_adaptive_graphics(): # Check if already initialized
		_on_graphics_ready()
	else:
		SmartGraphicsSettings.initialized.connect(_on_graphics_ready)

func _on_graphics_ready():
	# Now it's safe to access SmartGraphicsSettings functions and properties
	print("Smart Graphics Settings Ready!")
	SmartGraphicsSettings.set_target_fps(90)
```

See the [technical documentation](addons/smart_graphics_settings/README.md#handling-initialization-timing) for more details.
